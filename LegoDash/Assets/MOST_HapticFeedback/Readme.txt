 The baisc haptics List names are exactly the same as the iOS UIToolKit (limited only to these feedbacks)
 + i have used these names on android as well to make an eqv haptics for android (default-like haptics)...

 also using iOS Haptics, i have created ready to use haptics for android and give it Pattern and amplitudes (what android haptic system uses)
 check Most_HapticFeedback - IOSDefaultHapticsToAndroidPatterns() - line 84 if you want to modify these default values

 Haptic With Cooldown is very useful on continuous haptic spamming, for example... Sliders, continuous damage...
 the cooldown value you will add will disable haptic feedback only from 'Haptic With Cooldown' function

 You can't spam Haptics according to iOS API, this will leading to ignore haptic calls and send error message, that's why "Haptic With Cooldown" system :)
